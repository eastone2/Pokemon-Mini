--------------------------------------------Pokemon Mini--------------------------------------------
Pokemon Mini is a replication of the popular game, Pokemon. It will not necessarily be a specific copy of a version of Pokemon 
but a replication of the general experience. The user will be able to walk around, gather pokemon, and interact with a 
few objects. There will be two buildings, one will be to check the status of pokemons and heal and the other will 
be a building with mazes and battles. The battle will involve a Minimax AI that will choose the best moves within its ability
and there will be a button that shows the solution to the maze using BFS Algorithm.
